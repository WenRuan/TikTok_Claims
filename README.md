TikTok Project!

**THIS IS THE CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR THE GOOGLE ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS CERTIFICATION**

This project is based on a scenerio provided by TikTok. I will be using provide data sets from TikTok as well as the Google Team working on the certification course.


SCENERIO:
You have just started as a data professional at TikTok.
The team is still in the early stages of the project. You have received notice that TikTok's leadership team has approved the project proposal. To gain clear insights to prepare for a claims classification model, TikTok's provided data must be examined to begin the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).


Included in this project git are:

- A data set for the TikTok Claims data
- A Jupyter notebook that I'm currently working on to perform EDA on the given data set.
- A Tableau Public file for viewing the visuals created for the project
- Executive summaries of what I have proposed with the gathered data
